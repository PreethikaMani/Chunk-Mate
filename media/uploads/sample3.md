# Software Design Principles

## 1. SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle

Every module/class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality.

### Open/Closed Principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

## 2. DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself

Avoid code duplication. Extract common logic into functions or services.

## 3. KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid

Simplicity should be a key goal in design.

## 4. YAGNI – You Aren’t Gonna Need It

Don't implement something until it is necessary.

## 5. Separation of Concerns

Break programs into distinct sections that address a separate concern.
